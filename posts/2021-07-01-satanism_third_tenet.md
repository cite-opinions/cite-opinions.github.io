# Satanism's 3rd Tenet Is Not Broad Enough

A quick disclaimer: What is referred to as satanism in this post is the rationalist-adjacent organization known as The Satanic Temple (TST), and NOT the Church of Satan (CoS). One is recognized as a tax exempt church by the IRS and is progressive and politically active, and the other thinks that liking blue cheese means you're gay. The latter (CoS) will not be acknowledged within this article.

For a group often derided by generalization as "edgy athiests", The Satanic Temple is a quite fascinating group. They have a set of core tenets which are extremely egalitarian, and provide a good base on which to construct your moral system. Such moral systems are compatible with liberal, libertarian, and even some conservative opinions and viewpoints. Some fall short in lexical construction, however, and I believe their third tenet could be better. The human mind is an incredibly complex thing that we still don't fully understand, and recent research (alongside An Opinion from personal experience) leads me to believe their third tenet isn't quite broad enough.

I'll repeat them here, so you don't have to click away, but the [Tenets of The Satanic Temple](https://thesatanictemple.com/) are thus:

```I
I: One should strive to act with compassion and empathy toward all creatures in accordance with reason.
II: The struggle for justice is an ongoing and necessary pursuit that should prevail over laws and institutions.
III: One’s body is inviolable, subject to one’s own will alone.
IV: The freedoms of others should be respected, including the freedom to offend. To willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forgo one's own.
V: Beliefs should conform to one's best scientific understanding of the world. One should take care never to distort scientific facts to fit one's beliefs.
VI: People are fallible. If one makes a mistake, one should do one's best to rectify it and resolve any harm that might have been caused.
VII: Every tenet is a guiding principle designed to inspire nobility in action and thought. The spirit of compassion, wisdom, and justice should always prevail over the written or spoken word.
```

The third tenet, as written here, is, as far as I can interpret, a reactionary encapsulation of a set of neatly interrelated human rights that covers body control and modesty regulation, with a little bit of leeway for future necessary political activism. The authors saw there was a problem, and attempted to advise practitioners on how they should behave regarding it, but their limited view of the future made it less useful than it could have been. It's primary purpose is to emphasize that the Outer Realms should not be allowed to change you(r body) or regulate you(r body) without your consent. This can definitely cover a satanic practitioner's opposition to several things:
- sexual assault
- normal assault and battery
- ban of abortion services
- restriction of access to birth control
- restriction of access to affirmative gender identity support
- forms of modesty regulation (like banning nudist practices)
- exploitation and human trafficking
However, as written, this is as far as it goes.

CGP Grey expresses what I intend to say very well in his video, [I, Phone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ZpsxnmmbE).
"Thinking of your phone as an extension of yourself isn't crazy... The phone now is an extension of the self... but we all know where this is going. A computer chip in your skull will eventually be as quasi-mandatory as a phone is today... If we don't protect our most intimate digital devices as part of the self, legally... Access to your phone today, is unavoidably, access to your mind tomorrow."
Our digital devices are very important and close to us - the brain will often treat external tools as [extensions of the mind](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797610371962), in a neurological sense and not just philosophical. Active sensory systems will impose data they observe into your model of external tools and interpret them as physically part of your body. And as our future is (optimistically speaking) inevitably post-human, with sensors that let us taste the entirety of the electromagnetic spectrum, ears that hear the cosmic background, tongues that see precise atomic and isotopic composition, and limbs that provide active feedback even better than our brain's best approximations, we must protect the right to self as everything you are. 

The third tenet only includes the physical body you inhabit. It does not cover the shapes you form your mind into and the diversity of your thought structures, your computational augments like your cellphone and neural lace, your login-identity secrets like passwords and keys and social identity graphs, your right to self determination, your personal private information, your legal name, your chosen names. And it therefore does not directly oppose abuse, brainwashing, doxxing, or unreasonable search-and-seizure of objects that you see as yourself, but that the law may see as apart from you.

I will fully admit that I'm a bit on the extreme side of morphological freedom advocates. I would gladly cast aside my bipedal form for a revolving system of iridescent spheres with telekinesis and tentacles, even if that isn't my preference. But even if you're not as rabidly transhumanist as I, the third tenet must ALSO imply and specify that _not only are others not allowed to change you without your consent, the right to change yourself is fundamental_. For those who are transgender, who hope for peace from their injuries, who have lost limbs and senses, or lack the form they believe they should have had. The third tenet must be broadened to cover these, too.

I am uncertain whether or not some of the contexts I've built up around some words are mine, or universal, but here is what I'd do to expand the third tenet into it's proper, broad form.

```I
III: One’s self is inviolable, mutable to one's own will alone.
```

To cover the sanctity of the self, the sanctity of the mind, the sanctity of the identity and the sanctity of the form.
